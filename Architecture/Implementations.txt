1. Conceptual Architecture Implementation
The conceptual architecture will be implemented as a modular system where each component has a clear, single responsibility. The data acquisition component will use lightweight web scraping libraries, the storage component will leverage SQLite for persistent storage, and analysis components will utilize specialized libraries for technical analysis, sentiment processing, and machine learning predictions.

2. Execution Architecture Implementation
The execution architecture focuses on process-level interactions, using asynchronous processing and message-passing between components. Each major function (scraping, analysis, prediction) will run as a separate process, communicating through SQLite database queries and lightweight messaging. The web server will orchestrate these processes, providing a unified interface for data retrieval and analysis.

3. Implementation Architecture Implementation
The implementation architecture will be a collection of Python modules, each utilizing specific infrastructure libraries for its core functionality. The scraper will use requests for web interactions, sqlite3 for database management, ta-lib for technical indicators, nltk for sentiment analysis, and numpy/pandas for data manipulation and machine learning preprocessing.
